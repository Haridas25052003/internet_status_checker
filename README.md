# internet_status_checker
The Online Status Checker is a simple web-based project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that dynamically detects the user's internet connectivity status in real-time. It helps users understand whether they are online or offline by displaying a clear message on the screen.

When the internet connection is active, the application displays a message like “You are Online” with a green indicator. When the connection is lost, it immediately changes to “You are Offline” with a red indicator or alert.
